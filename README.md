## 🔧 What I Worked On

During the internship, I gained hands-on experience with:

* ✅ Core Python programming
* ✅ File handling and exception management
* ✅ Web scraping using `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`
* ✅ Automation scripts using `Selenium`
* ✅ Data analysis and visualization using `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn`
* ✅ API integration using `requests` and `Flask`
* ✅ Mini Projects (e.g., Weather App, To-Do List CLI, PDF Merger, etc.)
* ✅ Debugging, testing, and documentation of Python scripts
